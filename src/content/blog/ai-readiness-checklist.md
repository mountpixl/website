AI is only as good as the foundation you build it on. Before you spend a dollar on AI tools or consulting, run through this checklist to make sure your business is actually ready to benefit from AI.

This isn't about whether AI is right for your business — in 2026, every business can benefit from some level of AI and automation. This is about making sure you're set up to get **real results** instead of wasting time and money.

## The AI Readiness Checklist

### 1. You Have Clear, Repetitive Processes

**Ask yourself:** Can I describe, step by step, how my team handles common tasks?

AI excels at automating processes that are:
- Done frequently (daily or weekly)
- Follow a consistent pattern
- Have clear inputs and outputs
- Don't require unique creative judgment every time

If your processes are chaotic and different every time, you need to standardize before you automate. AI can't automate chaos — it'll just automate it faster.

**Action item:** Document your top 5 most time-consuming repetitive tasks, step by step.

### 2. Your Data Is Accessible

**Ask yourself:** Is our important business data in systems we can actually connect to?

AI agents and automation tools need access to your data. That means:
- Your CRM, accounting software, and project management tools have API access or integration support
- Your data isn't trapped in spreadsheets that only one person can access
- You're not running critical processes through paper forms or shared email inboxes

**Action item:** List the tools where your critical business data lives. Check if they have API access or integration support.

### 3. You Can Define "Success"

**Ask yourself:** What would a successful AI implementation look like for us?

Before you start, you need to know what you're measuring. Good success metrics are:
- Hours saved per week
- Error rate reduction
- Response time improvement
- Revenue impact (leads processed, deals closed)
- Customer satisfaction scores

**Action item:** Pick 2-3 specific metrics you want to improve, and document your current baseline.

### 4. You Have a Realistic Budget

**Ask yourself:** Are we prepared to invest in implementation, not just tools?

The tool subscription is the smallest part of the cost. Budget for:
- **Implementation:** Someone needs to set it up properly (either your team or a consultant)
- **Training:** Your team needs time to learn the new workflow
- **Iteration:** The first version rarely works perfectly — plan for refinement
- **Ongoing maintenance:** Tools need monitoring and occasional updates

For most SMBs, a realistic starting budget is **$1,000-5,000 for implementation** plus **$200-500/month in tool costs.**

**Action item:** Set a clear budget for your first AI initiative, including implementation costs.

### 5. Your Team Is On Board

**Ask yourself:** Does my team see AI as a threat or an opportunity?

AI implementations fail more often due to resistance than technology issues. Your team needs to understand:
- AI is here to **handle the boring stuff** so they can do more interesting work
- They'll be **involved in the process**, not replaced by it
- There will be a **learning curve** and that's okay
- The goal is to make **their jobs better**, not eliminate them

**Action item:** Have an honest conversation with your team about AI. Address concerns directly.

### 6. You're Willing to Start Small

**Ask yourself:** Can we commit to starting with one automation and building from there?

The biggest mistake businesses make with AI is trying to do too much at once. A successful approach:
- Picks **one high-impact task** to automate first
- Sets a **30-day pilot** with clear success criteria
- Gathers feedback and iterates before expanding
- Uses early wins to build momentum for bigger projects

**Action item:** Identify the single task that would have the biggest impact if automated.

### 7. You Have (or Can Get) Technical Support

**Ask yourself:** Who will implement and maintain our AI solutions?

You don't need a CTO, but you do need someone who can:
- Set up and configure AI tools
- Connect tools to your existing systems via APIs
- Troubleshoot when things break
- Optimize as your needs change

This can be an internal team member, a freelancer, or a consulting partner like Mount Pixl.

**Action item:** Identify your technical resource — internal or external.

## Scoring Your Readiness

Count how many of the 7 items you can check off:

- **6-7 checks:** You're ready. Start implementing now.
- **4-5 checks:** Almost there. Address the gaps and you'll be ready within a month.
- **2-3 checks:** You have some groundwork to do, but it's worth starting the conversation.
- **0-1 checks:** Focus on building foundations first. Standardize processes and organize data before investing in AI.

## What Happens After You're Ready

Once you've checked off most of this list, the next steps are:

1. **Pick your first automation target** (the task with the highest time waste)
2. **Choose the right approach** (off-the-shelf tool, custom integration, or AI agent)
3. **Implement and test** (start with a small pilot)
4. **Measure results** (compare against your baseline metrics)
5. **Expand** (apply what you learned to the next task)

The businesses that get the most from AI aren't the most technically sophisticated — they're the ones that are **prepared, focused, and willing to start small.**
