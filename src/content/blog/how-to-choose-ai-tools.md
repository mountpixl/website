There are over 10,000 AI tools on the market right now. New ones launch every day. Every vendor promises to "revolutionize your business with AI."

So how do you actually choose?

After helping dozens of businesses evaluate and implement AI tools, here's the framework we use. It works whether you're looking at a $20/month SaaS product or a custom-built AI agent.

## The 5-Question Framework

Before you evaluate any AI tool, answer these five questions:

### 1. What specific problem does this solve?

This sounds obvious, but most businesses get it backwards. They find an interesting AI tool and then look for a use case, instead of starting with a problem and finding the right solution.

**Good:** "We need to reduce the 15 hours per week our team spends on invoice processing."

**Bad:** "AI is the future and we need to use it somehow."

If you can't clearly articulate the problem in one sentence, you're not ready to buy a tool.

### 2. What does the workflow look like without this tool?

Map out exactly how the task is done today, step by step. This serves two purposes:

- It helps you evaluate whether a tool actually addresses the bottleneck
- It gives you a baseline to measure improvement against

You might discover that the real problem isn't the task itself, but a broken process upstream that no tool can fix.

### 3. Does this integrate with our existing tools?

The best AI tool in the world is useless if it can't connect to the systems you already use. Check for:

- **Native integrations** with your CRM, email, accounting software, etc.
- **API access** for custom connections
- **Zapier/Make/n8n compatibility** for no-code connections

An AI tool that creates a data silo is worse than no tool at all.

### 4. What's the total cost of ownership?

The sticker price is just the beginning. Consider:

- **Subscription costs** (and what happens when you exceed plan limits)
- **Implementation time** (someone has to set it up and configure it)
- **Training time** (your team needs to learn how to use it)
- **Maintenance** (who handles updates, troubleshooting, and optimization?)
- **Exit cost** (how hard is it to switch if the tool doesn't work out?)

### 5. Can we start small and scale?

The best AI implementations start with a narrow scope, prove value quickly, and then expand. Avoid tools that require a massive upfront commitment or a complete process overhaul before you can see any results.

Look for tools that let you:
- Start with a single use case or workflow
- Test with a small team before rolling out company-wide
- Pay monthly (not annual-only contracts)
- Easily adjust or turn off if it's not working

## The Tool Categories That Matter Most for SMBs

Here's where we see the highest ROI for small-to-medium businesses:

### Communication & Email
- **What it does:** Automates email responses, follow-ups, and sequences
- **Best for:** Sales teams, customer service, appointment-based businesses
- **Examples:** Custom AI email agents, email sequencing tools

### Document Processing
- **What it does:** Extracts, validates, and routes data from documents
- **Best for:** Accounting, legal, admin-heavy businesses
- **Examples:** AI-powered OCR, custom document processing agents

### Workflow Automation
- **What it does:** Connects tools and automates multi-step processes
- **Best for:** Any business with repetitive, multi-tool workflows
- **Examples:** n8n, Make, Zapier

### Content Creation
- **What it does:** Drafts, edits, and optimizes content
- **Best for:** Marketing teams, agencies, content-driven businesses
- **Examples:** Claude, GPT-4, custom content agents

### Customer Support
- **What it does:** Handles common inquiries and escalates complex ones
- **Best for:** Any business with recurring customer questions
- **Examples:** Custom AI support agents, chatbots with agent capabilities

## Red Flags to Watch For

Avoid AI tools that:

- **Promise to replace your entire team** — Good AI augments humans, it doesn't replace them
- **Can't explain how they work** — If the vendor can't clearly explain the technology, proceed with caution
- **Lock you into long contracts** — Especially if you haven't tested the tool yet
- **Don't provide usage metrics** — You need to be able to measure whether the tool is delivering value
- **Require you to change your entire workflow** — The best tools adapt to how you already work

## The Honest Truth

Most businesses don't need 10 AI tools. They need **1-3 well-chosen, well-configured solutions** that address their biggest pain points.

The companies that succeed with AI aren't the ones who adopt the most tools. They're the ones who adopt the right tools, implement them properly, and actually use them consistently.
